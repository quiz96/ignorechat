# ignorechat
The chat idea is really simple. Imagine that Alice wants to send Bob a message. So she sends the message. Now in IngoreChat, the message gets stuck, and until Bob sends Alice a message, Bob will not see the message. Now say that Bob sends her a message. Then Bob gets Alice's message, and Bob's message is now stuck, invisible to Alice until she sends him a message. That's the idea.

*It can actually takes several messages from Bob to receive Alice's message.
