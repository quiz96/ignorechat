# Quickstart

Open the .py file in a command line using python 3. Enter a username. The username should be long to avoid conflicts. /send user message sends a message to the user. /terminate disconnects the client. You will still have to close the window yourself.

If your username conflicts, the program will not tell you that it does. It will not tell you if it is connected or not. There is no way to check if you can message anyone else. However, if by a stroke of luck, you get a message, and you message that user several times after, you will get that message, and be able to see that you are connected. You could also just use a friend. 

The chat idea is really simple. Imagine that Alice wants to send Bob a message. So she sends the message. Now in IngoreChat, the message gets stuck, and until Bob sends Alice a message, Bob will not see the message. Now say that Bob sends her a message. Then Bob gets Alice's message, and Bob's message is now stuck, invisible to Alice until she sends him a message. That's the idea.

*It can actually takes several messages from Bob to receive Alice's message.
